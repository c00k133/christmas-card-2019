# Christmas Card 2019

This small project is my electronic Christmas Card for 2019.
Simple, yet elegant.

## Tech

The project is a simple [pug](https://pugjs.org/) that generates the static HTML containing all snowflakes.
To actually make the snowflakes move though theres a CSS file that does the magic, generated by a SCSS file.

#### Building

To build the card run the following:
```
npm run build
```

If you only want the generated HTML:
```
npm run pug
```

or CSS:
```
npm run scss
```

#### Development

For development you can run:
```
npm run pug-watch
```

or:
```
npm run scss-watch
```

To watch for changes.
